<b> Author notes </b>: <br>  
<ul>
  <li> The code is the mean, not the paper. The methodologies need to be understood before the application (GIGO); </li>
  <li> If you use the code, part of it, or get inspired by it, I would truly appreciate it if you could cite it. Changing the name of the variables and spacing is still        considered plagiarism.</li> 
  <li> The code does not contain ggplot2 figures. It contains the data. Adding the figure code does not add any value to the reproducibility of the paper.</li> 
  <li> All the analyses are disclosed, with no hidden stuff, no secret.</li>
  <li> If there are any mistakes, I would be happy to address them. Humans can make mistakes. Please address any issue politely, independently from your job position,          and awards.</li> 
  <li> Hope you enjoy it. I attempted to make the code as clear as possible. </li>
