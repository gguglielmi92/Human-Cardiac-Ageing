<b> Author notes </b>: <br>       
1) The code is the mean, not the paper. The methodologies need to be understood before the application (GIGO). 2) If you use the code, part of it, or get inspired by it, I would truly appreciate it if you could cite it. Changing the name of the variables and spacing is still considered plagiarism. 3) The code does not contain ggplot2 figures. It contains the data. Adding the figure code does not add any value to the reproducibility of the paper. 4) All the analyses are disclosed, with no hidden stuff, no secret. 5) If there are any mistakes, I would be happy to address them. Humans can make mistakes. Please address them politely. 6) Hope you enjoy it. I attempted to make the code as clear as possible.
