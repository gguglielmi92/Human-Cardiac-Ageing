-The code is the mean, not the paper. The methodologies need to be understood before the application (GIGO).<br>
                    -If you use the code, part of it, or get inspired by it, I would truly appreciate it if you could cite it. Changing the name of the variables and spacing is still considered plagiarism. 
                    -The code does not contain ggplot2 figures. It contains the data. Adding the figure code does not add any value to the reproducibility of the paper.
                    -All the analyses are disclosed, with no hidden stuff, no secret. 
                    -If there are any mistakes, I would be happy to address them. Humans can make mistakes. Please address them politely.
                    -Hope you enjoy it. I attempted to make the code as clear as possible.
